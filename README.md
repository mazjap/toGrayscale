# toGrayscale
A simple Java program that converts an image to grayscale. I made this program because I wanted to work on something I knew little about: Pixel manipulation.

## Getting Started

- Download repository
      
- Change directory by running ``` cd /File/Path/Of/toGrayscale-master/ ```

- Run ``` javac Main.java ``` in terminal

- Run ``` java Main ``` in terminal

- Profit
